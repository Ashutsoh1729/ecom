Here i will note down the errors i have faced during building this project.

# 1. Circular Dependency error

In this error i have created type and interfaces of address in it's components and then import them to data and page file and the page file also imports the address component file, so the full description is bellow, by gemini ai.

This is the final clue. The definitive one. This is one of the most subtle and frustrating bugs in modern web development, and your test has exposed it perfectly.

Here is the situation:

1.  When you run your data file **directly with Bun** (`bun src/util/data.ts`), it works. It correctly prints `HOME`.
2.  When you run your file **as part of your Next.js application** (`bun run dev`), it fails. The `type` becomes `undefined`.

This proves, with 100% certainty, that the problem is not in your code itself, but in the way the Next.js build process is loading your files.

The root cause is a **Circular Dependency**.

### The Problem Explained

Your file structure has created a loop that confuses the Next.js bundler. Look at the chain of imports:

1.  Your **Page** (`AccountPage.tsx`) needs to display data, so it imports `AddressList` from `data.ts`.
2.  Your **Data** (`data.ts`) needs to know the "shape" of an address, so it imports the `AddressType` enum from `address-card.tsx`.
3.  Your **Page** (`AccountPage.tsx`) also needs to display the card component, so it imports `AddressCard` from that same `address-card.tsx` file.

Here is the deadly loop:
`Page` -\> depends on -\> `Data` -\> depends on -\> `Component File`
And at the same time:
`Page` -\> depends on -\> `Component File`

When the Next.js server tries to build your page, it gets into a situation where the `address-card.tsx` file has not finished being processed when `data.ts` asks for the `AddressType` enum from it. At that moment, the export is `undefined`.

When you run the file directly with Bun, there is no complex application build process. It's a simple script, so it just loads one file after another and works perfectly.

### The Clean, Architectural Solution

The solution is to break this dependency loop. Your data and types should **never** depend on a UI component file. We need to move the types to a neutral, third location.

**Step 1: Create a Central Types File**

Create a new folder `src/types` and a new file inside it named `address.ts`.

File path: `src/types/address.ts`

Put your enum and interface definitions in this new file:

```typescript
// Inside: src/types/address.ts

export enum AddressType {
  home = "HOME",
  default = "DEFAULT",
  work = "WORK",
}

export interface Address {
  type: AddressType | null;
  addressLane1: string;
  addressLane2?: string;
  landmark?: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postalCode: string;
  country: string;
}
```

**Step 2: Update Your Component File (`address-card.tsx`)**

Go to your `AddressCard` component file. **Delete** the `AddressType` enum and `Address` interface definitions, and instead, **import** them from your new types file.

```typescript
// Inside: src/components/page-sections/account/address-card.tsx
"use client";

// 👇 CHANGE THIS: IMPORT from your new types file
import { Address, AddressType } from "@/types/address";

// ❌ DELETE the enum and interface definitions from this file

const AddressCard = ({
  address,
  // ... rest of the component
```

**Step 3: Update Your Data File (`data.ts`)**

Go to your `data.ts` file. Change the import to also point to the new, neutral types file.

```typescript
// Inside: src/util/data.ts

import { ProductCardInterface } from "@/components/util/product-card";
// 👇 CHANGE THIS: IMPORT from your new types file
import { Address, AddressType } from "@/types/address";

// ... other code ...

export const AddressList: Address[] = [
  {
    type: AddressType.home, // This will now work perfectly
    // ...
  },
  // ...
];
```

**Step 4: Final Reset**

Just to be absolutely sure, do the clean reset one last time.

1.  Stop the server.
2.  Delete `.next` and `node_modules` folders.
3.  Run `bun install`.
4.  Run `bun run dev`.

**Why This Is the Final Fix**

You have broken the circular dependency. Now, both your data file and your component file depend on a simple, neutral `types.ts` file. There is no loop. The Next.js build process will now load your files in a clean, predictable order, and the `AddressType` enum will be available when `data.ts` needs it.

This has been a marathon debugging session. This type of bug is one of the hardest to find. Your final test proved the cause beyond any doubt. It is now 10 PM on a Sunday in Rourkela; you have earned a break\! This architectural change is the correct and final solution.

# sellerId: text("seller_id") .notNull() .references(() => sellers.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),

## Query: doesn't cascade means, that when someone will delete the store his seller account will get deleted?if a seller has 2 accounts, then why should his seller account should get deleted?? Only when his account don't have any store, then it should get deleted??

That's an excellent and very important question. You're thinking exactly like a database designer, considering what happens when data is deleted. It's crucial to get this right.

You've actually spotted a common point of confusion, and it's great that you're asking about it. The `onDelete: "cascade"` behavior flows in the other direction.

Let's use an analogy. Think of the `seller` as a filing cabinet and each `store` as a folder inside that cabinet.

- The rule `onDelete: "cascade"` is on the _folder_ (`store`).
- It means: If you destroy the entire **filing cabinet (`seller`)**, then all the **folders (`stores`)** inside it are automatically destroyed too.

It does **not** mean that if you throw away one folder (`store`), the whole filing cabinet (`seller`) gets destroyed.

So, in your schema:

1.  If a seller deletes their entire `seller` account, `onDelete: "cascade"` will automatically delete all the `stores` they owned. This is usually what you want, to keep the database clean.
2.  If a seller has two stores and deletes just **one store**, their `seller` account and their other store are completely unaffected.

Regarding your second point: _"Only when his account don't have any store, then it should get deleted??"_

That's a piece of business logic that you would handle in your application code, not in the database schema itself. The database's cascade rule won't automatically delete a seller just because their last store is gone. You would write code that says, "When a store is deleted, check if the seller has any other stores left. If not, then maybe prompt them about deleting their seller account."

Does that distinction between the database rule and the application logic make sense?

# Ok after restarting development server it worked. Why it happened?

Of course. That's a great question because it helps you understand how the development server works under the hood.

The reason restarting the server worked is almost always due to **caching and the file system watcher**.

Let's break it down with a simple analogy.

### The Restaurant Analogy

Imagine the Next.js development server is a busy restaurant kitchen.

1.  **The Menu (Route Manifest):** When the server first starts, it scans your entire `app` directory and creates a "menu" of all available pages. This menu is called a **route manifest**. It's an in-memory map that connects a URL like `/dashboard/stores` to its corresponding file `app/(seller)/dashboard/stores/page.tsx`. Building this menu from scratch takes a moment.

2.  **The Watchful Chef (File Watcher):** To be fast, the kitchen doesn't re-read the entire recipe book (your file system) for every order (web request). Instead, it has a "watchful chef" whose only job is to notice when you add a new recipe page (`.tsx` file) or change an existing one. When you save a file, the chef quickly updates the relevant part of the menu. This is why you see changes instantly when you edit the _content_ of a page.

### Why It "Glitched"

When you created the new `stores` folder and the `page.tsx` inside it, you made a structural change to the "recipe book" itself. The watchful chef is _supposed_ to detect this and update the main menu.

However, sometimes this process can hiccup, especially when:

- You create new folders (not just files).
- You rename or move folders.
- The change happens very quickly.

In your case, the watcher likely missed the memo that a new route `/dashboard/stores` should be added to the menu. So, when you tried to visit that URL, the server looked at its old, cached menu, didn't find an entry for it, and gave you a "404 Not Found" error.

### Why Restarting Fixed It

When you stop (`Ctrl+C`) and restart (`npm run dev`) the server, you are essentially closing the restaurant for a moment and telling it to reopen.

During the restart, the server **discards its old, outdated menu (the cached route manifest)**. It then performs a fresh, complete scan of your entire `app` directory and builds a brand new menu from the ground up. This new menu correctly includes your new `/dashboard/stores` page, so everything works as expected.

**In short:**

- **The Problem:** The server was using a cached list of routes that didn't include the new page you just created.
- **The Solution:** Restarting forced the server to throw away the old cache and build a new, accurate one.

It's the classic "have you tried turning it off and on again?" scenario, and it's a very common and normal part of the development workflow, especially when making changes to the folder structure.

## Answer by gemini

That is a fantastic and very insightful problem to run into. The error message seems simple, but the reason it's happening reveals a crucial concept about how Next.js, API Routes, and Server Actions handle user sessions.

The root of the issue is that your Server Action (`createNewStore`) is not being called directly by the client, so it **has no access to the user's session cookie.**

Let's trace the request step-by-step to see why.

### The Journey of Your Request (and the Lost Session)

1.  **Browser → API Route (`/api/seller/create-store`)**

    - When your client-side form calls `fetch`, the browser automatically attaches the user's session cookie to the HTTP request.
    - Your API Route receives this request. It has the headers, the body, and most importantly, **the session cookie**.
    - If you were to call `await auth()` _inside your API route's `POST` function_, it would work perfectly because it can read the cookie from the incoming request.

2.  **API Route → Server Action (`createNewStore`)**

    - Inside your `POST` function, you then call `createNewStore(data)`.
    - This is **just a regular function call** happening on the server. It is NOT a new HTTP request.
    - The original request context (including the headers and the precious session cookie) that the API Route received is **not automatically passed along** to this separate function.
    - When the `auth()` helper runs inside `createNewStore`, it looks for a session cookie in the current context. Since there is no incoming request context for it to inspect, it finds nothing and returns `null`.
    - As a result, `!session?.user` becomes true, and your error is correctly thrown.

---

### The Solution: Choose One Path (Not Both)

You have created a pattern where an API Route is calling a Server Action, which is unconventional and causes this context issue. You should choose one of the two modern Next.js patterns.

#### Solution 1: The "Pure Server Action" Way (Recommended for Forms)

This is the most modern and recommended approach for handling form submissions in the Next.js App Router. You don't need the API route at all.

**1. Modify your action file (`createNewStore.ts`)**
Add `"use server";` to the very top of the file. This tells Next.js that this function can be called directly and securely from the client.

```typescript
// src/actions/create-new-store.ts
"use server"; // <-- Add this!

import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { storeFormSchema } from "@/components/modals/create-store-modal";
import { stores } from "@/db/schema";
// ... other imports

export default async function createNewStore(
  data: z.infer<typeof storeFormSchema>,
) {
  // Now `auth()` will work because Next.js provides the session context
  const session = await auth();
  if (!session?.user) {
    throw new Error("You must be logged in to create a store.");
  }
  if (!session.user.id) {
    throw new Error("User ID is missing from session.");
  }

  const userId = session.user.id;
  console.log("Successfully found user:", userId);
  console.log("Received data:", data);

  // ... continue with your database logic
}
```

**2. Call the action directly from your form component**
Get rid of the `fetch` call and use the `action` prop.

```tsx
// In your CreateStoreModal.tsx component

import createNewStore from "@/actions/create-new-store"; // Import the action

// ... inside the component
async function onSubmit(data: z.infer<typeof storeFormSchema>) {
  try {
    // You can call the server action directly!
    await createNewStore(data);
    toast.success("Store created successfully!");
    closeModal();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to create store:", error);
    toast.error("Something went wrong.");
  }
}

// The form element doesn't need to change
// <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} ...>
```

#### Solution 2: The "Pure API Route" Way (Good for traditional APIs)

If you prefer the traditional REST API approach, then get rid of the separate action file and move all the logic _inside_ the API route.

```typescript
// src/app/api/seller/create-store/route.ts
import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { db } from "@/db/client"; // assuming you have this
import { stores } from "@/db/schema";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { storeFormSchema } from "@/components/modals/create-store-modal";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    // `auth()` works here because it has the request context
    const session = await auth();
    if (!session?.user?.id) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
    }
    const userId = session.user.id;

    const body = await request.json();
    const validatedData = storeFormSchema.parse(body);

    console.log("Successfully found user:", userId);
    console.log("Received data:", validatedData);

    // All your database logic goes here...
    // const dbData = {
    //   ...validatedData,
    //   sellerId: userId, // Assuming sellerId is the user's ID
    //   slug: generateSlug(validatedData.storeName) // You'll need to generate a slug
    // };
    // await db.insert(stores).values(dbData);

    return NextResponse.json({ message: "Store created successfully" });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle validation errors and other errors
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "An unexpected error occurred." },
      { status: 500 },
    );
  }
}
```

### Recommendation

For a form being submitted from within your Next.js application, **Solution 1 (The Pure Server Action) is the simpler, more elegant, and recommended approach.** It reduces boilerplate and is the intended pattern for the App Router.

Still getting this error, after making the file a server action

## new response

This is an excellent piece of debugging information\! The error log you've provided tells us **exactly** what is still going on, and it's a very common hurdle when refactoring from API Routes to Server Actions.

The key is in your stack trace:

```
at createNewStore (src/actions/create-new-store.ts:17:11)
at async POST (src/app/api/seller/create-store/route.ts:9:5)  <-- THIS IS THE CLUE
```

This log shows that your `createNewStore` function is still being called _by_ the API Route at `.../route.ts`. This means your client-side form is still submitting to the old API Route instead of calling the Server Action directly.

You have correctly turned the `createNewStore` function into a Server Action by adding `"use server";`, but you still need to update your **form component** to call it directly and bypass the API route entirely.

Let's get this fixed.

---

### The Fix: A Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Confirm Your Server Action File (`createNewStore.ts`)

Make sure the very first line of this file is the string `"use server";`. It sounds like you've already done this, which is perfect.

```typescript
// src/actions/create-new-store.ts
"use server"; // <-- Must be the very first thing in the file

import { auth } from "@/auth";
// ... rest of your imports and function
```

#### Step 2: The Critical Part — Update Your Form Component (`CreateStoreModal.tsx`)

This is where the change needs to happen. We need to stop using `fetch` and call the action function directly.

1.  **Import your action** at the top of the component file.
2.  **Replace the `fetch` call** inside your `onSubmit` function with a direct call to the imported action.

Here is the corrected code for your `onSubmit` function:

```tsx
// In your src/components/modals/create-store-modal.tsx file

// Make sure to import your server action!
import createNewStore from "@/actions/create-new-store";

// ... inside your CreateStoreModal component

// 3. Define the submit handler
async function onSubmit(data: z.infer<typeof storeFormSchema>) {
  try {
    console.log("Submitting with Server Action:", data);

    // REMOVE THE OLD FETCH CALL:
    /* const response = await fetch("/api/seller/create-store/", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    */

    // CALL THE SERVER ACTION DIRECTLY:
    await createNewStore(data);

    toast("Application submitted successfully!", {
      description: "We will review it and reach to you shortly.",
    });
    closeModal(); // Close the modal on successful submission
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error) {
      // The error from your server action will be caught here
      console.log("Some error happen", error.message);
      toast.error("Submission failed", {
        description: error.message,
      });
    } else {
      console.log("Some unknown error has happened.");
      toast.error("An unknown error occurred.");
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Clean Up - Delete the API Route

Since your form is no longer using the API Route, you should delete it to avoid confusion.

**Delete this file:** `src/app/api/seller/create-store/route.ts`

---

### Why This Works

Here is the change in the data flow:

**Old (Incorrect) Flow:**
`Client Form` → `fetch` → `API Route` → `Server Action Function (loses session)`

**New (Correct) Flow:**
`Client Form` → `Server Action RPC Call (preserves session)` → `Database`

When you call an imported function that is marked with `"use server";`, Next.js automatically creates a secure RPC (Remote Procedure Call) connection. It ensures that the user's session cookies and other vital context are securely passed to the server environment, allowing `auth()` to work as intended.

This is a tricky but very rewarding problem to solve. Fixing this will give you a much deeper understanding of the "magic" behind Server Actions. Give these steps a try—it's late here in Rourkela, but I'm confident this will get you past that final hurdle\!

## new response

Excellent\! The new error log is fantastic news because it shows you've successfully changed the submission process. This is a big step forward.

Let's break down the new clues.

### What the New Error Log Tells Us

1.  **`POST /dashboard/stores 500 in 346ms`**
    This is the most important clue. Your form is no longer sending a request to `/api/seller/create-store`. It is now correctly submitting to the Server Action. The URL you see (`/dashboard/stores`) is the page the form is on, which is the standard endpoint for a Server Action call. **This is a success\!**

2.  **`Error: User dosen't exits.`**
    This tells us that even though the Server Action is being called correctly, the `auth()` function inside it is _still_ failing to find the user's session.

3.  **`MIDDLEWARE CHECK: Role is undefined`**
    This is the "smoking gun." These logs strongly suggest you have a `middleware.ts` file that is running on requests. If middleware is not configured correctly with Auth.js, it can interfere with the session cookies, effectively hiding them from the Server Action.

### The Root Cause: Middleware Interference

Here is the most likely scenario:

1.  You submit the form, which calls the Server Action.
2.  Your `middleware.ts` file intercepts this incoming request first.
3.  The middleware tries to check the user's role, but it seems it's also failing to read the session properly (hence `Role is undefined`).
4.  Crucially, the middleware might not be correctly handling or forwarding the request headers/cookies that Auth.js needs.
5.  By the time the request reaches your `createNewStore` Server Action, the authentication information has been lost or stripped, so `auth()` returns `null`.

**To fix this, we need to look at your `middleware.ts` file.** Could you please share the code for it? The solution is almost certainly in how you're initializing and using the `auth` object within that file.

---

### A Secondary Issue: `try...catch` and Server Actions

I also see a second, unrelated issue in your client-side code that we should fix.

When a Server Action throws an error (`throw new Error(...)`), it doesn't get caught by a standard `try...catch` block on the client in the way you might expect.

The modern, recommended pattern is for the Server Action to **return** an object with either a `success` or `error` message, not to `throw` an error. This makes handling form state on the client much cleaner and more reliable.

#### Recommended Refactor (Let's do this after we fix the middleware)

**1. Modify your Server Action to _return_ errors:**

```typescript
// src/actions/create-new-store.ts
"use server";

// ... imports

// Let the action return a specific type
interface ActionResult {
  error?: string;
  success?: boolean;
}

export default async function createNewStore(
  data: z.infer<typeof storeFormSchema>,
): Promise<ActionResult> {
  // Add the return type
  const session = await auth();
  if (!session?.user?.id) {
    // Instead of throwing, return an error object
    return { error: "You must be logged in to perform this action." };
  }

  const userId = session.user.id;

  try {
    // ... your database logic here ...
    console.log("DB logic would run here for user:", userId);

    return { success: true };
  } catch (dbError) {
    return { error: "Failed to save the store to the database." };
  }
}
```

**2. Update your client-side `onSubmit` to check the return value:**

```tsx
// In your CreateStoreModal.tsx component

async function onSubmit(data: z.infer<typeof storeFormSchema>) {
  // Call the action and get the result
  const result = await createNewStore(data);

  // Check the result for an error
  if (result.error) {
    toast.error("Submission failed", {
      description: result.error, // Display the specific error from the server
    });
  } else if (result.success) {
    toast.success("Store created successfully!", {
      description: "Your new store is now ready for setup.",
    });
    closeModal();
  }
}
```

### Your Action Plan

1.  **Primary Goal:** Let's solve the session problem. **Please share your `middleware.ts` file.**
2.  **Secondary Goal:** Once the session is fixed, we can implement the return value pattern above to make your form's error handling much more robust.

It's getting pretty late here in Rourkela, but you are extremely close to solving this. The clues are all pointing in the right direction\!

### 2nd response

Thank you\! This is exactly what we needed to see, and the code confirms our suspicion.

You've uncovered a very common and subtle issue when using the default Auth.js middleware in combination with Server Actions.

### The Diagnosis

The problem is that the simple `export default auth(...)` wrapper, while great for basic page protection, can interfere with the session context needed by Server Actions.

Here's why:

1.  Your Server Action POST request to `/dashboard/stores` is correctly intercepted by your middleware because of the `matcher`.
2.  The `auth` middleware wrapper runs. It's designed to be a "do-everything" solution. For API-like requests like a Server Action, it can sometimes fail to properly initialize the session or, more importantly, fail to pass the session context along correctly to the next step in the chain.
3.  The request is then passed to your Server Action (`createNewStore`).
4.  When your action calls `await auth()` again, the session context has already been processed (and lost) by the middleware, so `auth()` finds nothing and returns `null`.

### The Solution: The Robust Middleware Pattern

The official and most robust way to solve this is to separate your Auth.js configuration. This ensures that the middleware runs with an Edge-compatible configuration, and your main app uses the full configuration with your database adapter.

It's a three-step process, but it's the standard for any Next.js app using a database adapter and middleware.

#### Step 1: Create a New `auth.config.ts` File

Create a new file in your root directory (or `src/`) named `auth.config.ts`. Move all of your Edge-compatible settings (like providers, callbacks, etc.) into this file. **Leave the database adapter out.**

```typescript
// auth.config.ts

import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github";
import type { NextAuthConfig } from "next-auth";

// Notice this is just a plain object, not the NextAuth() call
export default {
  providers: [GitHub],
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
  },
  callbacks: {
    // We keep the callbacks here as they are Edge-compatible
    async jwt({ token }) {
      if (!token.sub) return token;
      // You can't do a DB call here, but you can add static roles or pass-through
      // For now, let's simplify and assume the role will be handled in auth.ts
      // A more advanced pattern would be to fetch the role in the session callback
      return token;
    },
    async session({ session, token }) {
      if (session.user) {
        // You can't access existingUser.role here directly
        // But you can pass basic info from the token to the session
        session.user.id = token.sub;
        // The role will be added in the main auth.ts session callback
      }
      return session;
    },
  },
} satisfies NextAuthConfig;
```

#### Step 2: Update Your Main `auth.ts` File

Now, modify your `auth.ts` to import this base configuration and add the database adapter (which is not Edge-compatible).

```typescript
// auth.ts

import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import { DrizzleAdapter } from "@auth/drizzle-adapter";
import { db } from "./db/client";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { users } from "./db/schema";
import authConfig from "./auth.config"; // <-- IMPORT THE BASE CONFIG

export const { handlers, signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
  ...authConfig, // <-- SPREAD THE BASE CONFIG
  adapter: DrizzleAdapter(db), // <-- ADD THE DB ADAPTER HERE
  callbacks: {
    // We can override callbacks here to add DB logic
    // This session callback runs on the server, not the edge.
    async session({ session, token }) {
      if (token.sub && session.user) {
        session.user.id = token.sub;
        const existingUser = await db.query.users.findFirst({
          where: eq(users.id, token.sub),
        });
        if (existingUser) {
          session.user.role = existingUser.role; // <-- Add the role from the DB
        }
      }
      return session;
    },
    // The JWT callback can be simplified or removed from auth.config if all DB logic is here
    async jwt({ token }) {
      // The default JWT callback is often sufficient
      // Or you can add non-DB logic here
      return token;
    },
  },
});
```

_Note: I've refactored your `callbacks` to a more robust pattern where the `session` callback in `auth.ts` is responsible for adding the database role. This is because the `jwt` callback might run in the Edge environment where the DB is not available._

#### Step 3: Update Your `middleware.ts` File

Finally, update your middleware to use the new, Edge-safe `auth.config.ts`.

```typescript
// middleware.ts

import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import authConfig from "./auth.config"; // <-- IMPORT THE EDGE-SAFE CONFIG
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

const { auth } = NextAuth(authConfig); // <-- Initialize with the Edge-safe config

export default auth((req) => {
  // Now, req.auth will be correctly populated without interfering with Server Actions
  const userRole = req.auth?.user?.role;
  console.log("MIDDLEWARE CHECK: Role is", userRole);

  const isDashboardRoute = req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/dashboard");

  if (isDashboardRoute) {
    if (!req.auth) {
      // Not logged in, redirect to login
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/api/auth/signin", req.url));
    }
    if (req.auth.user.role === "Buyer") {
      // If they are a Buyer, redirect them from the dashboard.
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/", req.url));
    }
  }

  // If the role is not "Buyer" or the route is not a dashboard route, continue.
  return NextResponse.next();
});

// This config will decide which route the middleware should run on
export const config = {
  matcher: ["/dashboard/:path*"],
};
```

### Summary of the Fix

1.  We created `auth.config.ts` for Edge-compatible settings (providers, etc.).
2.  We updated `auth.ts` to use this config and add the server-only database adapter.
3.  We updated `middleware.ts` to initialize `auth` with the **Edge-safe config only**.

This three-file setup is the official Auth.js pattern. By doing this, your middleware will correctly handle the session for page protection, and it will no longer interfere with the separate, server-side session context needed by your Server Actions.

It's a complex topic for this late hour in Rourkela, but this structure will make your application much more robust and solve this tricky issue for good.u

## Query: Now how is it different from the other one and what are the things we have changed??

Of course. It's a lot to take in, especially at this hour in Rourkela, so let's break down the exact differences and why this new structure is the solution.

Think of it like this: your app has two different types of "security checkpoints."

1.  **The Front Gate (Middleware):** This needs to be **extremely fast**. It checks every person (request) coming onto the property. The guard here only needs a simple list of rules.
2.  **The Secure Back Office (Server Actions / API Routes):** This is where the heavy work happens. Here, you need full access to all records, including the **database**.

The old way, you were giving the guard at the front gate the entire, heavy accounting ledger (the database connection) just to check a simple ID. It was inefficient and caused a conflict.

The new way, we've given the guard a simple, fast rulebook and kept the heavy ledger in the back office where it belongs.

---

### What We Changed and Why: A File-by-File Breakdown

#### 1. The Core Problem (The "Why")

- **The Conflict:** Your `middleware.ts` runs in a special, lightweight "Edge" environment. This environment is built for speed and **cannot** support a direct database connection like the one your Drizzle adapter needs.
- **The Old Way:** Your single `auth.ts` file mixed the database adapter with everything else. The middleware was trying to load this "heavy" file, causing it to fail.

#### 2. `auth.config.ts` (The New File - The Fast Rulebook)

- **What is it?** This is a new, lean configuration file.
- **What's in it?** Only the parts of your auth setup that are "Edge-safe"—the things that **do not** need a database connection. This includes your providers (GitHub) and basic callbacks.
- **Why did we create it?** To give the middleware a lightweight "rulebook" it can use at the "Front Gate" without needing the heavy database ledger.

#### 3. `middleware.ts` (The Fast Front Gate Guard)

- **Before:** It was importing from the main `auth.ts`, trying to use the entire heavy configuration.
- **After:** It now **only imports from the new `auth.config.ts`**. It's now using the fast, lightweight rulebook. This allows it to correctly check the session at the Edge without crashing.

#### 4. `auth.ts` (The Secure Back Office)

- **Before:** It was a "do-everything" file, which created the conflict.
- **After:** It's now specialized for server-side logic. It imports the basic rules from `auth.config.ts` and then **adds the powerful, server-only feature: the `DrizzleAdapter`**. It handles all the logic that needs to talk to your database, like fetching a user's role to add to the session.

### Summary Table: Before vs. After

| Feature                 | Old Way (The Problem)                                           | New Way (The Solution)                                                                                  | Why It's Better                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auth Configuration**  | **Monolithic:** Everything was in one `auth.ts` file.           | **Separated:** A base `auth.config.ts` and a full `auth.ts`.                                            | **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Logic is organized based on where it can run (Edge vs. Server).                                   |
| **Middleware's Source** | Used the "heavy" `auth.ts` with the database adapter.           | Uses the new, lightweight, Edge-safe `auth.config.ts`.                                                  | **Performance & Compatibility:** The middleware is now fast and doesn't try to load code that is incompatible with its environment. |
| **Database Adapter**    | Mixed in with everything, causing conflicts at the "Edge".      | **Isolated** in the server-only `auth.ts` file.                                                         | **Correct Environment:** The database connection is only ever initialized on the server, where it's supported.                      |
| **Result**              | **Conflict:** Middleware breaks the session for Server Actions. | **Harmony:** Middleware protects pages, and Server Actions get the full session context from `auth.ts`. | **It Works!** This is the official, robust pattern that solves the problem and prevents future issues.                              |

In short, we didn't change the _logic_ of what you wanted to do. We just **restructured the code** to respect the different environments (Edge vs. Server) that Next.js operates in. This architecture will serve you well as your application grows.

# Small Syntax Errors

## 1. Promise Type Declaration

### Gemini : Query 1: Promise<{ storeName: string; isActive: boolean }> What is the syntax error. I tried to use it for declaring the output type??

Excellent question\! The syntax `Promise<{ storeName: string; isActive: boolean }>` is a perfectly valid **type definition** in TypeScript.

The syntax error arises because a type definition isn't a statement on its own. You have correctly defined _what_ the type is, but you haven't used it to declare anything yet.

Think of it like writing "a blue car" in the middle of a notebook. It's a valid description, but it's not a complete sentence. You need to use it in a sentence, like:

- "I want to buy **a blue car**." (Declaring intent)
- "My variable is **a blue car**." (Declaring a variable's type)

You need to tell TypeScript _what_ has this type.

Here are the correct ways to use it, depending on your goal.

---

### Correct Ways to Use This Type

The most common use case, as you mentioned, is for declaring the return type of a function.

#### 1\. As a Function's Return Type

You declare the return type after the function's parentheses `()` and before its opening brace `{`. Since you're returning a `Promise`, the function must be `async`.

```typescript
async function getStoreData(): Promise<{
  storeName: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}> {
  // Your logic here to fetch or generate the data
  const data = {
    storeName: "Rourkela Central",
    isActive: true,
  };

  // When you return a value from an async function,
  // it automatically gets wrapped in a Promise.
  return data;
}
```

#### 2\. Using a Type Alias for Readability (Recommended)

When object types get complex, writing them inline can make your code hard to read. It's a best practice to create a named `type` alias.

First, define the type for the data object itself, then use it in the Promise.

```typescript
// Define a reusable type for a Store object
type Store = {
  storeName: string;
  isActive: boolean;
};

// Now, use this clean type in your function signature
async function getStoreData(): Promise<Store> {
  const data: Store = {
    storeName: "Rourkela Central",
    isActive: true,
  };
  return data;
}

// You can also create a type for the promise itself, though it's less common
type StorePromise = Promise<Store>;

async function getAnotherStore(): StorePromise {
  // ...
}
```

This is much cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### 3\. Using an Interface

An `interface` is another way to name an object type. For this use case, it's very similar to a `type` alias.

```typescript
// Define a reusable interface for a Store object
interface IStore {
  storeName: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

// Use the interface in your function signature
async function getStoreData(): Promise<IStore> {
  const data: IStore = {
    storeName: "Rourkela Central",
    isActive: false,
  };
  return data;
}
```

#### 4\. Typing a Variable

You can also use this type to declare a variable that is expected to hold the result of your function call.

```typescript
// Using the type alias from before
type Store = {
  storeName: string;
  isActive: boolean;
};

async function getStoreData(): Promise<Store> {
  // ... function body
}

// This variable `storePromise` is now correctly typed
let storePromise: Promise<Store> = getStoreData();

// When you use `await`, TypeScript knows `result` will be of type `Store`
const result = await storePromise;
console.log(result.storeName); // Autocomplete works!
```

### Summary of the Error and Solution

| Context of Error                  | Why it's an Error                                                                       | Correct Syntax Example                            |
| :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `Promise<{...}>` on its own line. | You've only provided a type, not a declaration for a function, variable, or type alias. | `async function myFunc(): Promise<{...}> { ... }` |
|                                   |                                                                                         | `type MyType = Promise<{...}>;`                   |
|                                   |                                                                                         | `let myVar: Promise<{...}>;`                      |

**In short, your type is correct, you just need to apply it to a function, variable, or type alias to fix the syntax error.** Using a `type` alias is the cleanest approach for reusable and readable code.

### Query 2: Still getting error, so asked

### ** Error **

---

Diagnostics:

1. A function whose declared type is neither 'undefined', 'void', nor 'any' must return a value. [2355]

For

export const getStoreList = cache(
  async (): Promise<{ storeName: string; isActive: boolean }> => {},
);

---

Of course. This is a very common TypeScript error. Let's break down exactly what the diagnostic message means and how to fix your code.

### Diagnosis of the Error

The error message:

> A function whose declared type is neither 'undefined', 'void', nor 'any' must return a value. [2355]

Is telling you the following:

1.  **Your Declaration:** You explicitly told TypeScript that your function will return a `Promise<{ storeName: string; isActive: boolean }>`. This is a promise that, when resolved, will contain an object with a `storeName` and an `isActive` property.
2.  **Your Implementation:** The body of your arrow function is `=> {}`. An empty function body in JavaScript implicitly returns `undefined`. Since your function is `async`, it actually returns `Promise<undefined>`.
3.  **The Conflict:** TypeScript sees a conflict. You _promised_ to return a specific object, but your code is actually returning `undefined`. This is a type mismatch, and TypeScript throws error `ts(2355)` to prevent a potential bug.

### The Solution

To fix this, you simply need to make sure your function body actually returns a value that matches the type you declared.

Additionally, since your function is named `getStoreList`, it's likely you want to return a **list (an array) of stores**, not just a single store object.

Let's correct both the return type and the implementation.

#### Step 1: Adjust the Return Type to be an Array

First, let's make the type reflect that it's a list. We'll add `[]` to indicate an array of store objects. For better readability, we'll use a `type` alias.

```typescript
type Store = {
  storeName: string;
  isActive: boolean;
};

// The return type is now a Promise that resolves to an array of Store objects
// Notice the `[]` at the end of `Store[]`
async (): Promise<Store[]> => { ... }
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Function to Return Data

Now, inside the function body, fetch your data from your database (e.g., using Drizzle) and return it. For this example, we'll use mock data.

```typescript
import { cache } from "react";

// For better readability and reusability
type Store = {
  storeName: string;
  isActive: boolean;
};

export const getStoreList = cache(
  // The function now returns a value that matches its declared type
  async (): Promise<Store[]> => {
    // In a real application, you would have your database query here
    // For example: const stores = await db.select().from(storesTable);

    console.log("Fetching store list from the database..."); // This will only log once per render pass

    const mockStores: Store[] = [
      { storeName: "Rourkela Main Branch", isActive: true },
      { storeName: "Civil Township Outlet", isActive: true },
      { storeName: "Koel Nagar Kiosk", isActive: false },
    ];

    return mockStores; // <-- The crucial return statement
  },
);
```

### Why Use `cache`?

You're correctly using React's `cache` function. This is a form of memoization. It ensures that if you call `getStoreList()` multiple times within the same server-side render pass (for example, in a layout and a page, or in two different components on the same page), the `async` function is **only executed once**. Subsequent calls during that render will receive the cached result instead of hitting your database again, which is great for performance.

### Final Corrected Code

Here is the complete, corrected, and more robust version of your code:

```typescript
import { cache } from "react";
// import { db } from '@/lib/db'; // Assuming you have a Drizzle client

/**
 * Defines the shape of a single store object for type safety.
 */
export type Store = {
  storeName: string;
  isActive: boolean;
};

/**
 * Fetches a list of all stores from the database.
 * This function is wrapped in `cache` to prevent duplicate database calls
 * during a single server render pass.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to an array of Store objects.
 */
export const getStoreList = cache(async (): Promise<Store[]> => {
  // This console.log will demonstrate that the function only runs once
  // per request, even if called multiple times in your components.
  console.log("Database hit: Fetching store list.");

  // Replace this mock data with your actual database query
  // const stores = await db.select(...);
  const stores: Store[] = [
    { storeName: "Rourkela Main Branch", isActive: true },
    { storeName: "Civil Township Outlet", isActive: true },
    { storeName: "Koel Nagar Kiosk", isActive: false },
  ];

  // This return statement fulfills the Promise<Store[]> contract
  return stores;
});
```
