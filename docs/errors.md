Here i will note down the errors i have faced during building this project.

# 1. Circular Dependency error

In this error i have created type and interfaces of address in it's components and then import them to data and page file and the page file also imports the address component file, so the full description is bellow, by gemini ai.

This is the final clue. The definitive one. This is one of the most subtle and frustrating bugs in modern web development, and your test has exposed it perfectly.

Here is the situation:

1.  When you run your data file **directly with Bun** (`bun src/util/data.ts`), it works. It correctly prints `HOME`.
2.  When you run your file **as part of your Next.js application** (`bun run dev`), it fails. The `type` becomes `undefined`.

This proves, with 100% certainty, that the problem is not in your code itself, but in the way the Next.js build process is loading your files.

The root cause is a **Circular Dependency**.

### The Problem Explained

Your file structure has created a loop that confuses the Next.js bundler. Look at the chain of imports:

1.  Your **Page** (`AccountPage.tsx`) needs to display data, so it imports `AddressList` from `data.ts`.
2.  Your **Data** (`data.ts`) needs to know the "shape" of an address, so it imports the `AddressType` enum from `address-card.tsx`.
3.  Your **Page** (`AccountPage.tsx`) also needs to display the card component, so it imports `AddressCard` from that same `address-card.tsx` file.

Here is the deadly loop:
`Page` -\> depends on -\> `Data` -\> depends on -\> `Component File`
And at the same time:
`Page` -\> depends on -\> `Component File`

When the Next.js server tries to build your page, it gets into a situation where the `address-card.tsx` file has not finished being processed when `data.ts` asks for the `AddressType` enum from it. At that moment, the export is `undefined`.

When you run the file directly with Bun, there is no complex application build process. It's a simple script, so it just loads one file after another and works perfectly.

### The Clean, Architectural Solution

The solution is to break this dependency loop. Your data and types should **never** depend on a UI component file. We need to move the types to a neutral, third location.

**Step 1: Create a Central Types File**

Create a new folder `src/types` and a new file inside it named `address.ts`.

File path: `src/types/address.ts`

Put your enum and interface definitions in this new file:

```typescript
// Inside: src/types/address.ts

export enum AddressType {
  home = "HOME",
  default = "DEFAULT",
  work = "WORK",
}

export interface Address {
  type: AddressType | null;
  addressLane1: string;
  addressLane2?: string;
  landmark?: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postalCode: string;
  country: string;
}
```

**Step 2: Update Your Component File (`address-card.tsx`)**

Go to your `AddressCard` component file. **Delete** the `AddressType` enum and `Address` interface definitions, and instead, **import** them from your new types file.

```typescript
// Inside: src/components/page-sections/account/address-card.tsx
"use client";

// üëá CHANGE THIS: IMPORT from your new types file
import { Address, AddressType } from "@/types/address";

// ‚ùå DELETE the enum and interface definitions from this file

const AddressCard = ({
  address,
  // ... rest of the component
```

**Step 3: Update Your Data File (`data.ts`)**

Go to your `data.ts` file. Change the import to also point to the new, neutral types file.

```typescript
// Inside: src/util/data.ts

import { ProductCardInterface } from "@/components/util/product-card";
// üëá CHANGE THIS: IMPORT from your new types file
import { Address, AddressType } from "@/types/address";

// ... other code ...

export const AddressList: Address[] = [
  {
    type: AddressType.home, // This will now work perfectly
    // ...
  },
  // ...
];
```

**Step 4: Final Reset**

Just to be absolutely sure, do the clean reset one last time.

1.  Stop the server.
2.  Delete `.next` and `node_modules` folders.
3.  Run `bun install`.
4.  Run `bun run dev`.

**Why This Is the Final Fix**

You have broken the circular dependency. Now, both your data file and your component file depend on a simple, neutral `types.ts` file. There is no loop. The Next.js build process will now load your files in a clean, predictable order, and the `AddressType` enum will be available when `data.ts` needs it.

This has been a marathon debugging session. This type of bug is one of the hardest to find. Your final test proved the cause beyond any doubt. It is now 10 PM on a Sunday in Rourkela; you have earned a break\! This architectural change is the correct and final solution.
